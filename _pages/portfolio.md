More about me 
======
* I like watching anime very much. Some of my favorite anime include Attack Giant, Ghost Annihilation Blade, Immortal You, King Ranking, Summer Reappearance, Link Click, etc.
* Long-distance running is a sport that can make people forget themselves. My weekly running distance is between 150 and 250 kilometers. I will definitely sign up for the marathons in the surrounding cities (but I seldom succeed in the lottery). The current best time for a half marathon is 1 hour and 55 minutes
* My two favorite singers are Taylor Swift and Silence Wang (汪苏泷). Both of them were born in 1989. Their songs are all very pleasant to listen to. Moreover, the fact that the two singers keep stepping out of their comfort zones and creating more interesting musical works can also give me strength. I have listened to Silence Wang's live performances many times before and I'm really happy. I hope to have the chance to hear Tarlor Swift's live performances in the future.
