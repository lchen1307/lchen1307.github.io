🥳 More about me 
======
* I really enjoy watching anime—it’s my favorite way to unwind after a long day. Some of the shows I love include Attack on Titan, Ghost Annihilation Blade, Immortal You, Ranking of Kings, Summer Reappearance, and Link Click. I’m always on the lookout for new series with great storytelling and unique animation. Anime often makes me laugh, cry, and think—it’s more than just entertainment to me.

* Running long distances is something I genuinely enjoy. It clears my head and gives me a sense of rhythm and focus. I usually run between 150 and 250 kilometers per week (yes, it’s a lot!). I often sign up for marathons in nearby cities—though I rarely win the lottery slots. My current best time for a half marathon is 1 hour and 55 minutes, and I’m working on beating it!

* My two favorite singers are Taylor Swift and Silence Wang (汪苏泷), both born in 1989. Their music is not only enjoyable, but also empowering. The way they consistently explore new styles gives me inspiration. I’ve attended Silence Wang’s concerts before, and I hope to experience Taylor Swift live someday.
