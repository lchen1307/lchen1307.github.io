 I am a master student majoring in Management Science and Engineering advised by [Prof. Lindong Liu](https://sites.google.com/view/ldliu/home) at the [School of Management](https://en.business.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/). I expect to graduate with a master's degree in the summer of 2026. Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. in Industrial Engineering from [Jiangnan University](https://english.jiangnan.edu.cn/) in 2023.

Research Interest
======
My research lies at the intersection of integer programming, machine learning, and statistics. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that are not only efficient but also reliable and fair, with the goal of supporting the design of cutting-edge decision-making tools. My work is often inspired by complex, real-world challenges emerging in high-stakes domains such as emergency management and two-sided platforms, where robust and equitable algorithmic solutions can have significant real-world impact.

***I am looking forward to beginning a Ph.D. journey in Fall 2026, where I hope to explore challenging problems and collaborate with researchers to create meaningful algorithmic solutions!***
